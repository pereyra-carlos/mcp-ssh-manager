# MCP SSH - Complete Guide to SSH Management via Model Context Protocol

This is the comprehensive guide for **MCP SSH Manager**, the leading Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for SSH remote server management.

## What is MCP SSH?

**MCP SSH Manager** is a complete **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that enables SSH remote server management directly from AI assistants like **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex**. It's the most comprehensive **SSH MCP** solution available, offering 37+ MCP tools for complete remote server control.

### Why MCP SSH Manager?

If you're searching for:
- **MCP SSH** server
- **SSH MCP** integration
- **Model Context Protocol SSH** tools
- **Claude Code SSH** support
- **OpenAI Codex SSH** compatibility
- **Remote SSH MCP** server
- **SSH automation with AI**

Then **MCP SSH Manager** is exactly what you need! 🎯

## MCP SSH vs Traditional SSH

Traditional SSH requires manual terminal commands and script writing. With **MCP SSH Manager**, you can:

1. **Natural Language Control**: "Deploy my app to production" instead of writing deployment scripts
2. **AI-Powered Automation**: Let Claude Code or Codex handle complex SSH operations
3. **Multi-Server Management**: Control multiple SSH servers from a single interface
4. **Enterprise Features**: Backup, restore, health monitoring, database management
5. **Zero Learning Curve**: Just ask your AI assistant what you want to do

## How to Use MCP SSH with Claude Code

### Quick Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager.git
cd mcp-ssh-manager
npm install
claude mcp add ssh-manager node /path/to/mcp-ssh-manager/src/index.js
```

### Natural Language SSH Commands

Once installed, simply ask Claude Code:

- "List my SSH servers"
- "Execute 'docker ps' on production"
- "Backup production database"
- "Monitor CPU usage on all servers"
- "Deploy files to staging server"
- "Check health of production server"

## How to Use SSH MCP with OpenAI Codex

### Codex Integration

```bash
ssh-manager codex setup
ssh-manager codex migrate
```

Configure in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.ssh-manager]
command = "node"
args = ["/path/to/mcp-ssh-manager/src/index.js"]
env = { SSH_CONFIG_PATH = "/Users/you/.codex/ssh-config.toml" }
```
